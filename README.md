# Train-Scheduler

Train Scheduler is an application that allows a user to enter in train information that will be saved to Firebase.

At any time the user can get on the site and see when the next train will arrive to their desired destination and how many minutes it is away.

The information is persistent and, once again, is being stored with Firebase. The times for the next train arrival is being rendered by MomentJS. Basic Bootstrap elements were used as well.
